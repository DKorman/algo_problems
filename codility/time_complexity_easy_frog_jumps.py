# PROBLEM:
# A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
#
# Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
#
# Write a function:
#
# def solution(X, Y, D)
#
# that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
#
# For example, given:
#
#   X = 10
#   Y = 85
#   D = 30
# the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
#
# after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
# after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
# after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
# X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
# X â‰¤ Y.

# TAKE 1:

def solution(X, Y, D):

    diff = Y - X
    mod = diff % D

    if mod > 0:

        return int((diff/D) +1)
    else:
        return int(diff/D)


# RESULT: 100%, correctnes 100%, performance 100%
# COMMENT: why was this so easy? Did I miss something? :S
# COMMENT: // operator (floordiv) can be used instead of int(diff/D)
